# Predicting Demand

Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental to return-back has become automatic. Through these systems, the user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues.

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated with the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc., can affect the rental behaviors. Several regression models have been developed to predict bike demand, through all other variables. And model has been improved by conducting various diagnostics.
